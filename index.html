            <p>
              Hello there! I'm a passionate game developer and web designer
              dedicated to crafting interactive, meaningful, and immersive
              digital experiences. My work centers on blending creativity with
              technology to deliver engaging user experiences across various
              platforms, with a particular focus on games and websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the
              University of Miami, complemented by minors in Mathematics and
              Interactive Media. Through both my academic journey and my roles
              as a student developer in cross-functional teams and a Teaching
              Assistant for two Computer Science courses, I've honed both my
              technical expertise and collaborative skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not working, I love expressing myself through
              musicâ€”whether it's belting out dramatic songs or playing the
              piano. I also love exploring narrative-rich games and new crochet
              projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feel free to explore my portfolio to see how I merge creativity
              with technology to build meaningful digital experiences.

                <li>Trombone: Has a long slide that can block an area or be walked on. The higher the note's pitch, the farther out the slide is pushed.</li>

            </div>

            <p>During my time as the lead developer (among the project's student developers) for this project at VESL (used to be called the XR Studio) at the University of Miami, I created the following features during our first completed iteration of this application...</p>
            
            <p>There are two main game modes for this application: The AR view and the in-game view. In the AR view, I made sure the island can properly spawn and remain static in front of the player. I have also given the player the abilities to rotate, zoom, and enter the island at a certain rotation with an iris shot transition effect. As seen in the image below, the new iteration also includes the buttons "reset" and "pan."</p>

            <div class="project-image-single">
              <img src="project_assets/temikki/TemikkiAR1.jpg" alt="Another AR view of the Temikki garden island that is zoomed out a bit to see it placed on a table surface. There are buttons to pan, rotate, reset rotation, or access the main menu.">
            </div>

            <p>In the in-game view, I added controls for the user to pan across the island with a digital joystick, zoom in or out, rotate the island, go back to the AR screen with the same iris shot transition, or access some of the UI sequences (i.e. the UI sequence to build lanterns containing dreams, the plant shop UI sequence, and the check-in UI sequence). In the new iteration, the buttons to return to the AR view or enter any of the dream sequences have been consolidated into a "main menu" button. And the ability to pan can now be done by just swiping since there are added toggle buttons to switch between panning and rotation.</p>

            </div>

            <p>I added a feature for the plants on the island to become yellow/dull if they have not been watered for a certain time duration. I also added the ability for a water pump to spray water particles that can revive yellowed plants in close proximity to the water pump, resetting the timer for those plants to become yellow again.</p>

            <p>During the final quarter of this application's first iteration, I worked on some of the UI sequences from scratch. The sequence I primarily worked on was the Dream UI sequence.
              It is a set of screens that allows a child using the application to create a lantern that will hold one of their dreams. In the first iteration, the Dream UI sequence
              involved the user typing out a dream lantern title, choosing the lantern color, adding their dream message as a text input, and having the date of the
              dream be automatically written for the lantern. There were a few other features that could not be fully fleshed out during the first iteration (adding
              drawings, images, sound files, etc.). The lantern could later be found in a list of completed lanterns with the options of editing or deleting a selected
              lantern.</p>
              
              <p>I was only able to accomplish most of this by hard-coding much of it. And the UI itself was transferred via a Unity Figma Bridge process that had many limitations for our purposes. There
              was a lot of effort that went behind this first iteration of a UI sequence which was later able to take more shape in future iterations. I also
              worked on some of the plant shop and check-in UI sequences during an electrifying time crunch. The newest iteration of the Dream UI sequence is pictured below.</p>

            </div>

            <p>In parallel with the Dream UI Sequence, I was also working on the backend portion for creating the actual dream lanterns. After the Dream
              UI sequence is completed, Temikki, the flying orange creature on the island, would hang the completed lantern on a new branch of the Temikki
              garden's central tree. For this process to work, I had to set up all positions at which a lantern could hang on the tree (there were about
              30 that could be hanging at once). And whenever a lantern was created from the UI sequence, a proper lantern object needed to be created with
              all the inputted data from the user to save that lantern and connect that specific lantern to its location on the tree. The lantern on the tree
              also needed to match the selected lantern color. This required a lot of data-focused work in addition to the UI sequence.</p>

            <p>We had another developer join the team to work on Temikki's behavior and animations. I had the responsibility of merging his changes to our main branch and making 
              sure Temikki was dropping off the lantern near the correct spot on the tree once the UI sequence was done. This is what the lantern-hanging process looked like...</p>

            </div>

            <p>Additionally, I made a password slider system work, which was going to be used for the Login UI sequence. It was a certain type of password in which
              users can choose a certain head, body, and set of feet for an animal as their password. There were 64 different password combinations that kids
              could use and better remember this way. There is no picture for this in the new iteration as this feature had to get cut out to comply with proper
              design standards. But this also needed to be hard coded, given a proper data-focused system, and transferred into Unity
              using the Unity Figma Bridge like the other UI sequences I brought into the application for the first iteration.</p>

            <p>There is a limited number of available screenshots from this project, but it was essentially a point-and-click quiz that asked and tested the user with scenario-based questions about how they would react if their hypothetical child experienced certain symptoms of an asthma attack or any other asthma-related issues. This point-and-click quiz was paired with models of children experiencing the asthma attack. There are animations and sound effects implemented to make the situation feel more immersive, providing the user with a proper simulation of what a real episode could look like.</p>
            
            <p>There are about 4 to 5 questions the user would need to answer during the simulation. The quiz is timed and is keeping track of the correct answers chosen. For ease of use as a learning tool, the user also has the option to reset the simulation. At the end of the quiz, the picture below is the results card that would appear in front of the user. The idea is for the simulation to be used as a tool to practice and remember the actions that a caregiver would need to take if a child is experiencing asthma-related symptoms.</p>

            <p>I worked on this project with another developer. We split the workload by completing Jira task tickets with difficulty points alotted by our PM. We built the UI and quiz mechanics and used free assets for the models and sound effects. I used Autodesk Maya and Audacity to adjust some of the animations and audio. I also used Adobe XD and Figma to create the initial wireframes as shown below. This is a snapshot of the inital ideas for the app's quiz-flow and surroundings.</p>

            <p>In addition to coding, adjusting assets, and creating the wireframes, I also assisted in the data collection for this study. I created an excel spreadsheet to help calculate and verify some of the statistical data. Our team collectively helped the PI carry out the study for this project, including the testing portion.

            <p>An online personality quiz to determine which of 19 Minecraft flowers the player is most like. For those who don't know, Minecraft is a large sandbox game with many features that are used in grand player builds and various combat and survival experiences. Some of the items a player can use or interact with include these 19 flowers that grow in various areas within the game's map. This quiz's content is specific to Minecraft's Java edition, version 1.20.4.</p>

            <p>Each question has answer choices, and if you hover over them, they will play small animations that scale up the button size. When a button is clicked, the answer is decided, disabling all the answer buttons in that question. Once all questions are answered, a results card pops up at the bottom of the screen, and the window automatically jumps to that area. You can see your assigned flower, a description, and all of the flowers with the amount of points you scored for each of them at the bottom. If you click on the names for any of those flowers, the screen will change to show you the chosen flower and description. You can refresh the page to take the quiz again or to have any of your friends take it!</p>
            
            <p>There are seven questions that assess the quiz-taker's... </p>
            <li>favorite color</li>
            <li>conversational nature</li>
            <li>desired hypothetical powers</li>
            <li>desired location to spend time in</li>
            <li>favorite animal</li>
            <li>favorite trait in a person</li>
            <li>favorite hobby</li>
            <p>These questions correlate to various traits about Minecraft flowers:</p>
            <li>effects on a player when used in Minecraft potions</li>
            <li>color of flower</li>
            <li>location/biome in which flower grows</li>
            <li>animals that love eating this flower</li>
            <p>I also connected answers to the results based on general hobby correlations with personality traits and color and flower symbolism in relation to personality. This quiz is fully made for the purpose of entertainment, but can still provide some light-hearted insight on a quiz-taker's personality.</p>
